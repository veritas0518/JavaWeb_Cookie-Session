There is an unspeakable feeling today. I received a rejection letter from Sheffield University told me by an intermediary near the early morning last night because our school is too poor and not competitive enough. Sheffield is really a university I want to go to. This feeling is really unspeakable. There will be a lot of trouble everywhere in a poor school. Now I can only hope in Leeds. I really don't want to go to Nottingham. I feel very tired. God, can you help me? Just this time, let Liz give me an offer. Then today, the stupid counselor listed the list and amount of people who didn't submit the relearning fee in the group. I've been hiding the secret for so long and was made public by his mother. I'm really speechless. How can there be such a person, but the students don't seem to know that I'm going abroad. It doesn't matter, Anyway, as long as someone asks, I say I really didn't pass the repair. Now it seems that British universities really only focus on the quality of schools and GPA. Hey, it seems that it is the same in any country in the world. I'll ha ha. I have to do the experiment tomorrow. The teacher said that he would not help us. There is really a brain problem. I don't know whether the experiment tomorrow can be completed. I really don't want to ask the laboratory to do the experiment on Thursday night.
